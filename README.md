# Watchiot Repository of Agents

Repository of agents

This project brings together all predefined configurations and agents.

## Introduction

You can see the _json_ response used by **WatchIoT** site

List of all repository configurations
http://agent.watchiot.org/repos

```
{"monitor_hd":{"title":"HD Monitor","abstract":"Hard drive monitor","image":"hd.svg","tags":"hardware"},"monitor_mem":{"title":"Memory Monitor","abstract":"Memory monitor","image":"mem.svg","tags":"hardware"}}
```

Into each configuration folder will be defined a config.yml file with the monitor parameters,
conditions and ways to notifications

We can access to the **monitor_hd**'s *config.yml* file requested the url
http://agent.watchiot.org/repos/monitor_hd/config.yml

```
{"yml":"params:\n    server_name: string\n    partition_name: string\n    total_space: integer\n    free_space: integer\n    use_space: integer\n    use_percet_space: integer\n    free_percent_space: integer\n\ncritical:\n    when: (server_name == \"my_server1\" and free_space < 2) or (server_name == \"my_server2\" and free_space <= 7)\n    repeat: 20\n    email:\n        tpl: You have the partition ${name} with ${free_percent_space} percent free"}
```

Into each configuration folder will be defined a readme.md file with the description on installation process and usage.
